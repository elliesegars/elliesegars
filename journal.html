    <h3>Heavy Traces</h3>

    <p>
I open a midnight window <br>
to wet summer air and <br>
sweet cicada song.<br>
And there's that familiar thrum<br>
of parents who pretend to love.<br>
And there's the boy<br>
with the quiet way about him,<br>
and Marigold who is my friend<br>
only when she calls,<br>
and there’s my aunt <br>
who hangs horseshoes and<br> 
emblems of hate,<br>
and the cicadas <br>
who only emerge from the dirt to sing and love<br>
        <div class="tab">then die.</div><br>
So don’t bother asking me<br>
what is the point of this life.<br>
<br>
I remember my Granny,<br> 
who knocks down<br>
hornet nests,<br>
while I watch with my brother<br>
on quilted spreads,<br>
tasting her cigarette perfume<br>
through an open window.<br>

<h3>Krish</h3>

<p>
 
Once, I loved winter <br>
But I’ve grown impatient for summer<br>
For sun on our skin<br>
For you to be here,<br>
The space between us <br>
No more than a medley <br>
Of soft words and <br>
Warm tones<br>
And lips upon lips.<br>
I think if you were here<br>
We’d sip wine from melted sand.<br>
You’d tie my bathing suit,<br> 
And brush my hair<br>
And I’d tell you how things are,<br>
Honestly <br>
I think if you were here<br>
I’d never be impatient again<br>

</p>

<h3>Peach Tea</h3>

<p>

It was raining while we swam in the ocean, your hands on my 
waist. The sun was setting <br>
behind a wall of gray. Everything 
was gray, except for your eyes. The warmest, brownest eyes <br>
 I’d ever seen sitting perfectly on either side of your nose. 
 Your black curls <br>
 dripped with saltwater, hung over your 
 forehead like fronds after a storm. <br>
 Brown and gray and black 
 and gray and brown. And you were shivering. <br>
 <br>
 Could you tell I 
 wanted to kiss you? Did I tell you just how badly I wanted to 
 kiss you? I can’t remember. <br>
I do remember that it was our last day together. That I rested
 my head on your shoulder and closed my eyes, knowing <br>
 you had to go, wishing we could stay this way forever.
