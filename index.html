    <center><p>Ellie Segars is a multimedia artist who is moved by the world, people, and struggles
        around her. For this reason, she is called to create art that centers around worldbuilding and connection.
        Whether it be a short film or a painting, she aims to create an altered sense of reality; a dreamlike state 
        that viewers can enter with curiosity, and leave with questions about themselves and their lives. <br>
        <br>
        Her process is a bit abstract and  unexplainable. She hates to admit that it is mostly intuitve, but it also draws
        from her emotions and memories. She feels that she has stories and realities trapped inside of her, begging to be
        released. This is something that she has felt since she was very young, and it is something that refuses to leave. <br>
        <br>
        Ellie hopes that her work will bring people together, and allow us to meet in a place where we can see that our struggles 
        are all interconnected.
